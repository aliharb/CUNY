## Social Utility

- In the last slide, you can see an extra column added: total utility.
- This is equal to the individual utility at each location times the population of each location
- or, $p \times u^T$, with p as the population vector and u as the utility vector, whose lengths are the number of locations.
- In this model, it is not guarenteed that people acting in their own self interest will lead to a socially optimal distribution.
