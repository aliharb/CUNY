            <p>The Bank of England performs a quarterly survey of the Business community across the UK. Included in these surveys 
                is a set of quantitative scores. These scores range from a low of -5 to a high of 5, and across eleven economic 
                concepts: demand (nominal turnover), exports, investment, capacity utilisation, employment, recruitment 
                conditions, total labour costs per employee, pay (salary per employee), non-labour costs, output prices, and 
                profits (growth in pre-tax profit as share of turnover).</p>
            <p>According to their documentation: <a href="http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/Documents/quarterlybulletin/2013/qb130106.pdf">The Agents' Company Visit Scores</a>, The Bank of
                England mapped seven of these score concepts to headline economic concepts coming from the Office of National 
                Statistics:</p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>ONS Economic Concept</th>
                    <th>Company Visit Score Concept</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Value Add</td>
                    <td>Demand (Nominal Turnover)</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Exports</td>
                    <td>Exports</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Business Investment</td>
                    <td>Investment</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Total Employment</td>
                    <td>Employment</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Average Weekly Earnings: Total</td>
                    <td>Total Labour Costs per employee</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Average Weekly Earnings: Regular Pay</td>
                    <td>Pay (Salary per employee)</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Gross Operating Surplus</td>
                    <td>Profits (Growth in pre-tax profit as share of turnover)</td>
                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>In addition, each of these scores have a current and a future component. Because the economic concepts are time
                series, the first comparison one could highlight of these scores is to view how average company visit scores have 
                changed over time. In this initial level of analysis, the future scores, when aggregated, should show some insight
                into how the economic concepts are expected to evolve. Below you can choose either current or future from the drop
                down menu:</p>
        </div>
        <div id="CurrentOrFutureDropDown"></div>
        <div id="CVSChart">
            <svg style='height:600px' />
        </div>
        <div id="MeanCVSDescription" class="hidden">
            <p>The mean company visit scores, for most concepts, track the percent changes of their corresponding economic
                concepts. While the future scores give some foresight into how economic concepts will evolve, the real 
                strength of having access to the underlying company scores is to get an idea of the distribution of scores
                in the economy.</p>
            <p>The scores released from the Bank of England include dates and broad industries to identify them. Below, choosing a
                date from the drop down menu will show a distribution of the scores at that point in time.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="DateDropDown">
            <!-- <select></select> -->
        </div>
        <div id="SectorDropDown">
            <!-- <select></select> -->
        </div>
        <div id="CVSHist">
            <svg style='height:600px'/>
        </div>
        <div id="CVSHistDescription" class="hidden">
            <p>In these histograms, you can see how the distribution of company visit scores change over time. In a lot of cases,
                one can visualize a near normal distribution moving back and forth depending on what its mean score is. Many
                concepts have a spike at score 0, perhaps highlighting a human preference in the scoring.</p>
            <p>As mentioned above, these scores are coded by broad sector. Selecting a sector from the drop down below will 
                update the histogram to display the distribution for that particular industry. In addition, the average company
                visit score line graph will be updated as well.</p>
            <p>This allows someone to seamlessly move across different scales, and see how changes in scales roll up to average
                behavior. The more differentiated classifications available, the more useful this sort of tool would be. For 
                example, if demographic and geographic data were added to these scores for example, one could filter by the 
                gender of the proprietor to see if women are more successful business owners in certain regions.</p>

        <div id="Conclusion" class="hidden">
            <p>"Big Data" has become a trendy buzzword, and there certainly are advances that are seeping into the the Economic 
                field. Companies like Premise and MIT's Billion Prices database are looking to collect granular pricing 
                information. <a href="http://www.citytheorist.com/2014/05/a-few-thoughts-on-satellite-sourced.html">Satellite 
                Imagery</a> can be used to gain geographic granularity, and in analyzing the nature of economic growth. </p>
            <p>Econometrics, however, has been around for a while. Macroeconomic concepts have been worked out and clearly defined
                over the years. Sector divisions have been standardized, and surveying techniques have been perfected by offices of
                national statistics to fine tune the aggregate picture of the economy they draw.</p>
            <p>The advances being made today are very real, and can allow us to have ever more clearer pictures of the economy. 
                Big data techniques work from the ground-up, and can give us a level of detail top-down macroeconomic measures 
                can't match. These ground-up advances need to be harmonized with the existing measures however or else we end up
                with two pictures of different underlying truths.</p>
