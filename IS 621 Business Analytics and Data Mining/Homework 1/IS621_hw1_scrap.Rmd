As one further test for these outliers, lets look at the Cook's distance in a straight linear model fit for Income, Price, and Age prediciting Sales:

```{r echo=FALSE}

model <- lm(Sales ~ Age + Income + Price, data = cigarettes)

plot(model,which=4)

rm(model)

```

Using the rule of thumb of $\frac{4}{n-2}$ suggests we could keep a few of the outliers, but given how much they differ from the Cook distance of the rest of the datapoints, I believe removing all outliers is the safest decision.
